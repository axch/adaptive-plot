;;;; Some geometry of parabolas

;;; I am interested in refining my plots with the points that make the
;;; most visual difference.  My heuristic for visual difference is
;;; that the new point should, locally, bring the piecewise-linear
;;; plot closest to the piecewise-parabolic plot, where closeness is
;;; measured by the area of the difference between them.  For this, I
;;; need to be able to answer the following geometric question:
;;;
;;;  "Consider the vertical parabola P passing through three points
;;;   p1, p2, p3, where the x coordinates are taken to be in order: x1
;;;   < x2 < x3.  [This parabola is given by Lagrange interpolation of
;;;   a polynomial quadratic in x through the given y coordinates.]
;;;   Call the area bounded by P and the segment [p1,p2] the 'left
;;;   lobe', and the area bounded by P and the segment [p2,p3] the
;;;   'right lobe'.  For each lobe, what is its area, and what are the
;;;   coordinates of that point x on P that forms the triangle of
;;;   maximum area with the segment bounding that lobe?"
;;;
;;; Let us call the answer to this question the "stats" of that lobe
;;; of that parabola.  I approach this question by the strategy of
;;; iterative simplification: from the general case, move p2 to the
;;; origin, then scale the vertical axis to make an obtuse parabola,
;;; then rotate the desired lobe so that segment lies on the x axis,
;;; and then the answer is obvious.  Unfortunately, I realized two
;;; years after writing the program that the rotation step at the end
;;; changes the parabola, so technically I am not actually answering
;;; the desired question but a different one.  However, the aesthetic
;;; results seem to be pretty good, so I haven't fixed it yet.  TODO.

;;; The stats of the given lobe of the parabola that goes through
;;; (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), under the condition that x1 < x2
;;; < x3.  Legal values for LOBE are 'left for the p1,p2 lobe and
;;; 'right for the p2,p3 lobe.
