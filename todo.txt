Minor improvements:
- call plot-sync-window! at least every 100ms so you always see an
  up-to-date line drawing
- make the autorefinement functions (e.g., plot-zoom-x!) accept
  adverbs to pass to plot-refine! ?
- allow the plot object to remember adverbs (e.g. given to new-plot or
  added with a new (plot-modify! plot . adverbs))?
- allow new-plot to accept an alist of points already computed from f before
  (e.g., by a previous plot whose plot object you did not want to save)
- add a merge-plots or plot-merge-points function for adding previously
  computed points from the same function to a plot in progress
- Proper y-range clipping might be implementable by adjusting the
  relevant-points abstraction and its segment-producing clients to
  produce cuts in the segment stream when a point in the x-range falls
  outside the y-range.  This affects segment splitting too.
