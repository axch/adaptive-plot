;;;; Plotting

;;; I'm fed up with Mechanics's default plotting facilities, so in a
;;; fit of fed-up-itude I started writing my own.  This is not quite
;;; finished.

;;; TODO Make it work in MIT Scheme without mechanics
;;; TODO Autorefinement (until curve is visually filled)
;;; TODO Generalize autorefinement to non-curves?  (e.g. chaotic trajectories)
;;; TODO Generalize to point sources that are not functions of the x dimension?
