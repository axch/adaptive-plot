;;;; Plotting

;;; I'm fed up with Mechanics's default plotting facilities, so in a
;;; fit of fed-up-itude I started writing my own.  This is not quite
;;; finished.

;;; TODO Generalize autorefinement to non-curves?  (e.g. chaotic trajectories)
;;; TODO Generalize to point sources that are not functions of the x dimension?
;;; TODO Generalize to multiple point sources
;;; TODO Clean up the code
;;; TODO A way to avoid autorefining randomized functions for too long
;;; TODO A way to specify refining by just densing up the x axis
;;;   without adaptation (good for randomized functions)
;;; TODO Make gnuplot output the default?  Find a way to give the repl
;;;   back while keeping a gnuplot window open?
