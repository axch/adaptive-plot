;;;; Plots

;;; A plot is a thing that knows what it's trying to plot, the x-y box
;;; in which it's trying to plot it (which may adapt to the data), the
;;; resolution within that box that it's trying to achieve, and the
;;; points it has so far.  A plot may also know a Scheme window into
;;; which to draw points as they appear, and updated line-drawings
;;; from time to time.
