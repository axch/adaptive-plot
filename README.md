Has this ever happened to you?

40 hours spent computing 40 data points, and all the insight you get
into your hard-to-compute function is Figure a?  Wouldn't you rather
have something like Figure b for the same effort?

Enter Adaptive Plot
===================

a library for intelligently plotting functions from the MIT Scheme
REPL.  Adaptive Plot lets you

- plot from the read-eval-print loop any real function you have
  implemented as a Scheme program,
- letting the library automatically choose how much and where to
  evaluate it to get a good picture.

For example, if you want to see sin(100x), as x varies from -1 to 1,
type:
```scheme
(load "adaptive-plot/load")

(gnuplot (lambda (x) (sin (* 100 x))) -1 1)
```
and you get
<table>
<tr><td align="center">
<img src="http://web.mit.edu/~axch/www/plotting/sin100x.png" alt="Good plot
 of sin(100x)">
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">
<p><b>Figure c</b>: sin(100x)
plotted with enough points to make out all the geometry, but no
legend.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>

This particular picture turned out to need 1672 points, placed
adaptively, to come out this good.  If you only use 100 points and
space them evenly (which is what typing `plot [-1:1] sin(100*x)` into Gnuplot
does by default) you get this:
<table>
<tr><td align="center">
<img src="http://web.mit.edu/~axch/www/plotting/sin100x-bad.png" alt="Bad plot
 of sin(100x)">
</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center">
<p><b>Figure d</b>: sin(100x) with only 100 points, evenly spaced.  This
is worse than ugly, it's deceptive, because the peaks are really all the
same height (see Figure c).</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
You can of course get Adaptive Plot to give you Figure d,
```scheme
(gnuplot (lambda (x) (sin (* 100 x))) -1 1 '(x-uniformly 98)
         '(commanding "title \"sin(100x)\""))
```
but why would you want to?

Live Plotting
-------------

One other nice thing Adaptive Plot does for you is that, if you have a
slow function you want to plot, you can see the points appear in a
Scheme window as they are computed.  You can also open up a Scheme
window showing a (partial) plot of a function, interact with that plot
object from the REPL, and see the effects show up in the window as
soon as they are computed.

So how do I get it?
===================

Just `git clone` this repository,
```scheme
(load "adaptive-plot/load")
```
and hack away.  Try out the example commandsx in `examples.scm`
and see how it works.

If you want to develop Adaptive Plot, you will want to also get the
unit test framework that Adaptive Plot uses.  Type `git submodule
update`.

I can haz Reference Manual?
===========================

Sure.

Concepts
--------

A *plot* of a function is really an ordered collection of (x,y)
points, where the x coordinates were chosen by some mechanism and the
y coordinates were computed by applying the function to those x
coordinates.

The actual pictures are *linear interpolations*&mdash;draw the leftmost
point, draw a straight line from it to the next point, then from there
to the next, etc.  (One could interpolate nonlinearly, for instance
with splines, but the point is to study the function, so I chose
linear interpolation for Adaptive Plot because it is very simple and
easily understood.)  This means that the picture you see is actually a
piecewise-linear approximation of your function.

A plot will look smooth when the line segments it is made of are small
enough compared to the angles they make with each other and the
thickness of the lines drawn on screen that your eye runs them
together into one curve.  In regions where the function being plotted
is almost linear, this can be accomplished with relatively sparse
sampling; in regions of high curvature, denser sampling is required.

Adaptive Plot watches the points that it computes when building a
plot, and, based on the choppiness of the piecewise-linear curve that
they make, [estimates](#plot-refinement-algorithms) whether additional
points are necessary and where
they would be most useful.

The *resolution* of a plot is the resolution of the screen on which
the plot is assuming it will be drawn: higher means features will be
more smoothed out (at the cost of computing the value of the function
at more points).  For best visual results, the resolution of the plot
should be at least as high as the resolution of the graphic where you will
actually draw it; however, you may wish to draw a low-resolution plot
on a high-resolution graphic to get a fast coarse view of an expensive
function.

Making Simple Things Simple
---------------------------

`(plot f xlow xhigh . adverbs)`

Draw the function `f` in a Scheme window.  The Scheme window is live,
in the sense that new points are added as soon as they are computed
rather than waiting for the plotting process to complete.  The
liveness is mainly useful when `f` is expensive to evaluate.  Return
the plot object.

You can control several aspects of how this is done by supplying
_adverbs_, which are either Scheme symbols or lists that begin with
Scheme symbols (you need to quote them to keep them from being
evaluated).  Later adverbs override earlier ones.  The adverbs
`plot` accepts are:

- `invisibly` tells `plot` not to actually draw the Scheme window.
  This is useful if you want to manipulate the resulting plot object
  some other way before looking at the plot.  See also `new-plot`,
  below.

- `visibly`, in contrast, requests the live Scheme window.  This is
  the default for `plot`, but e.g., `gnuplot`, below, does not show a
  live window by default.

- `adaptively`, `(adaptively res^2)`, `(adaptively xres yres)`,
  `(adaptively-with count)`, `(adaptively-to-with xres yres count)`,
  `x-uniformly`, `(x-uniformly xres)`, `y-uniformly`, `(y-uniformly yres)`,
  `uniformly`, and `(uniformly res)` control the [actual point selection
  algorithm](#plot-refinement-algorithms).
  The default is `adaptively`.

For example,
```scheme
(plot abs -1 1 '(adaptive-with 40))
```
would draw a plot of the `abs` function in a Scheme window using
exactly 40 points.

In addition, you can control the size of the generated Scheme window
by setting the global variables `*scheme-plot-window-x-res*` and
`*scheme-plot-window-y-res*`, and you can control the plot's default
target resolution by setting the global variables `*plot-x-res*` and
`*plot-y-res*`.

`(gnuplot f xlow xhigh . adverbs)`

Draw the function `f` in a Gnuplot window.  This operation is
synchronous: `gnuplot` does not return until you close the Gnuplot window.
Return the plot object.

By default, `gnuplot` does not draw a Scheme window while `f` is being
plotted, but passing it the `visibly` adverb will make it do so.  The
Scheme window will be closed when the plotting is done, to make room
for the Gnuplot window (since Gnuplot renders plots more
aesthetically).

`gnuplot` accepts all the same adverbs that `plot` does, plus two
more:

- `(prefixing str)` will insert the given `str` in the Gnuplot
  command stream before the `plot` command that draws the desired
  plot.  Use this, for instance, to ask Gnuplot to write the plot
  to a file.

- `(commanding str)` will insert the given `str` as an additional
  modifier at the end of the `plot` command that draws the desired
  plot.  Use this, for instance, to give a name to your function to
  appear in the legend.

For example, Figure b from the intro can be made with
```scheme
(define (the-function x)
  ... ; Lots of hairy Scheme code
  )

(gnuplot the-function -1 2 '(adaptive-with 40)
  '(commanding "title \"Adaptive placement of the same 40 evaluations"))
```

`gnuplot` will echo the Gnuplot command it ends up issuing to your
REPL so you can see how to use the `prefixing` and `commanding` adverbs to good
effect.  In particular, `gnuplot` sets up some reasonable defaults
using Gnuplot's `set`, but anything you prefix gets inserted after this,
so you can override it.

`(replot plot . adverbs)`, `(regnuplot plot . adverbs)`

Apply new adverbs to an existing plot and redraw (either in a Scheme
window or in Gnuplot, as appropriate).  Previously supplied adverbs
are not remembered, but previously plotted points are.  Adverbs that
indicate plotting with some number of points mean use that many more
points.

Plot Refinement Algorithms
--------------------------

*Parabolic* refinement compares the linear approximation to a locally
quadratic approximation (from sets of three consecutive
already-plotted points) and queries that x coordinate that brings them
closest together.  Parabolic refinement adds one point at a time, in a
greedy fashion: query wherever looks best at the time.  Parabolic
refinement is the default; you can also select it explicitly with the
`adaptively` adverbs, which also lets you control the stopping
condition.

- `adaptively` selects parabolic refinement until the plot's target
  resolution is reached (default 1200x960).

- `(adaptively res^2)` selects parabolic refinement until the given
  resolution, in units of total pixels, is reached.  (Parabolic
  refinement works on total area, so the target aspect ratio of the
  plot does not affect it).

- `(adaptively xres yres)` selects parabolic refinement until
  the given resolution.  Since parabolic refinement works on
  total area, this is equivalent to `(adaptively (* xres yres))`.

- `(adaptively-with count)` selects parabolic refinement for a fixed
  number of points, regardless of the resolution attained thereby.
  Note that the first 12 points are spaced uniformly along the x-axis
  to make an initial approximation to refine, so to actually benefit
  from parabolic refinement `count` should be more than 12.

- `(adaptively-to-with xres yres count)` is a combination of the
  previous two: refinement proceeds until either the desired
  resolution is reached or `count` points have been added, and then
  stops.

Arguments to `adaptively-with` and `adaptively-to-with` are optional.
Without the `count`, the latter reduces to `adaptively`; whereas the
former, without the `count`, will refine forever.

For example,
```scheme
(plot cos -10 10 '(adaptively-to-with 640 480 100))
```
will produce a plot of cos(x) between -10 and 10 that's good for
display at a resolution of 640x480, unless this takes more than 100
evaluations of cos, in which case it will stop at the best it can
do with 100 points.

*Uniform* refinement along either the x or the y dimension makes sure
that all segments are not too long in the given dimension, by trying
to break any such too-long segment up into the fewest uniform-length
pieces necessary to bring it down to size.  Uniform refinement in the
x dimension is therefore not adaptive at all (because the x
coordinates of new points do not depend on the values of the function
at old points), but uniform refinement in the y dimension is adaptive,
in the sense that it will throw points at regions where the function's
value is changing rapidly.

You can select uniform refinement along one or both dimensions with
the `uniformly` adverbs, as well as control the size it aims for

- `(x-uniformly xres)` makes the x-lengths of all segments shorter
  than the given resolution (higher resolution means shorter
  segments).

- `x-uniformly` makes the x-lengths of all segments shorter than the
  plot's x-resolution.  Note that the default for plot resolution is
  chosen with parabolic refinement in mind, so this adverb may be
  surprisingly expensive.

- `(y-uniformly yres)` tries to make the y-lengths of all segments
  shorter than the given resolution (higher resolution means shorter
  segments).  The attempt is made by breaking any y-longer segment
  uniformly in the x dimension; if the function is nonlinear, not all
  the resulting segments will necessarily have y-lengths shorter than the desired
  resolution.  y-uniform refinement is not automatically iterated,
  because if the function has a sufficienly large discontinuity,
  iteration would not terminate.

- `y-uniformly` tries to make the y-lengths of all segments shorter
  than the plot's y-resolution.

- `(uniformly res)` does `(x-uniformly res)` first and then
  `(y-uniformly res)`.

- `uniformly` does `x-uniformly` first and then `y-uniformly`.


Interactive Manipulation
------------------------

`(plot f xlow xhigh 'invisibly . more-adverbs)`

As a reminder, `plot` can be made to do the adaptive point selection,
but show no output.  It returns the plot object, which can be further
manipulated.

`(plot-draw! plot)`

Draw the given plot in a Scheme window and return the plot.  Does not
refine.

`(plot-zoom-x! plot #!optional new-xlow new-xhigh)`

Change the x boundaries of the given plot and compute more points (if
necessary) so that the new view reaches the plot's resolution, then
return the plot.  Useful for looking at a part of the function's
geometry more closely without recomputing the points already plotted,
or at a different region without forgetting the points already
plotted.  If either boundary is left off, set it to include all
avilable already plotted points (and at least the x coordinates -1 and
+1).  If this plot is being followed in a live Scheme window, its
boundaries become the new bounds.

`(plot-zoom-y! plot #!optional new-ylow new-yhigh)`

Clip the plot window to only show the curve within the given
boundaries in the y dimension and compute more points (if necessary)
so that the new view reaches the plot's resolution, then return the
plot.  Useful for avoiding being confused by a spike in the function.  If
either boundary is left off, include all y values in the direction (including ones the
function may produce in the future).  If this plot is being followed
in a live Scheme window, its boundaries become the new bounds.

`(plot-zoom! plot #!optional new-xlow new-xhigh new-ylow new-yhigh)`

Do both `plot-zoom-x!` and `plot-zoom-y!`.

`(plot-resolve! plot xres yres)`

Change the plot's resolution and compute more points (if necessary) so
that the current view reaches the new resolution, then return the plot.

`(plot-stop-drawing! plot)`

Get rid of the Scheme window (it will not be recreated until you call
`plot-draw!`), and return the plot.

`(plot-gnu! plot . adverbs)`

Draw the (current state of) the plot in a fresh gnuplot window and
return the plot.  Does not compute additional points.  Accepts the
adverbs `prefixing` and `commanding`, with the same effect as
`gnuplot`.


Interactive Querying
--------------------

`(plot-xlow plot)`, `(plot-xhigh plot)`, `(plot-ylow plot)`, `(plot-yhigh plot)`

Return the appropriate limit for this plot's range of interest.
Return the default object (which satisfies `default-object?`) if that
boundary is not constrained.

`(plot-dimensions plot)`

Return the bounding box the plot will be drawn in as four values:
`(xlow xhigh ylow yhigh)`.  This is not the same as calling
`plot-xlow`, etc, because it computes from the already plotted points
what the effective boundaries are for dimensions that are not
constrained.

`(plot-xresolution plot)` `(plot-yresolution plot)`

Return the target x- or y-resolution of the plot.

`(plot-pixels plot)`

Return the plot's target number of pixels.  This is just the product
of the x resolution times the y resolution, but is relevant because
the parabolic refinement algorithm does not care about the aspect
ratio.

`(plot-known-points-alist plot)`

Return all the points the plot has computed so far as a list of x-y
pairs.

`(plot-relevant-points-alist plot)`

Return the points that fall within the plot's current viewport
boundaries (xlow, xhigh, ylow, yhigh) as a list of x-y pairs.

`(plot-count plot)`

Return the number of points the plot has computed so far.


Manipulation Without Autorefinement
-----------------------------------

`(new-plot f xlow xhigh)`

Create and return a plot object, but do not make a Scheme window or
start refining.  Does not invoke the function to be plotted.

`(plot-resize-x! plot #!optional xlow xhigh)`,
`(plot-resize-y! plot #!optional ylow yhigh)`,
`(plot-resize!   plot #!optional xlow xhigh ylow yhigh)`

Like `plot-zoom*`, but do not compute additional points until called
for.

`(plot-new-resolution! plot xres yres)`

Like `plot-resolve!`, but do not compute additional points until called
for.

`(plot-refine! plot . adverbs)`

Manually invoke adaptive refinement, according to any `adaptively` or
`uniformly` adverbs supplied.  The default is `adaptively`.  Return
the plot object.  If there is a live Scheme window following this
plot, it will be updated as refinement proceeds.


Of Independent Interest
-----------------------

These two functions are utilities from the perspective of Adaptive
Plot, but may be useful independently of all the rest of this
machinery.  They are defined in the file gnuplot.scm, which has no
dependencies on any of the rest of Adaptive Plot, so may be lifted and
used elsewhere if desired.

`(gnuplot-alist alist . adverbs)`

Plot the given list of points (as x-y pairs) in gnuplot, according to
any supplied `prefixing` and/or `commanding` adverbs.

`(gnuplot-write-alist alist filename)`

Write the given list of points (as x-y pairs) into the given file
(overwriting it) in a format the Gnuplot is happy with.  Yes, this
function is trivial, but I already wrote it for you.


Developer Documentation
=======================

The developer documentation is the source code and the commentary
therein.  In particular, each source file has some discussion at the
beginning of what that file is about and what the salient things in it
are.  Here's a table of contents (and suggested reading order):

- Interesting stuff

  - `examples.scm`: A few plots commands for your pleasure.
  - `interface.scm`: Primary entry points, and user-level functions that
    don't clearly belong in another file.
  - `refinement.scm`: Uniform refinement, and the administration around
    parabolic refinement.
  - `locally-quadratic.scm`: The actual parabolic refinement loop and
    supporting data structures.
  - `parabolas.scm`: Geometry of parabolas, for parabolic refinement.
  - `todo.txt`: The "issue tracker".

- Semi-involved support

  - `drawing.scm`: Dealing with making, dropping, and updating any
    requested live Scheme windows.
  - `windowing.scm`: The actual mechanics of opening a window and
    drawing a point or a line on it.
  - `gnuplot.scm`: Gnuplot plotting of alist data.

- Fairly boring support

  - `plots.scm`: The actual data structure holding the things a plot
    remembers.
  - `point-sets.scm`: An abstraction for clipping sets of points in the
    plane.  The implementation is uninteresting, but this is a place
    where a proper range tree could be dropped in if overhead needed
    to be that low.
  - `utils.scm`: Two random utlities.
  - `auto-compilation.scm`: Automatically invoke the MIT Scheme
    compiler, if necessary and possible, to (re)compile files before
    loading them.  This has nothing to do with Adaptive Plot, but I
    figured copying it in was easier than making an external
    dependency.
  - `load.scm`: Orchestrate the loading sequence.  Nothing interesting
    to see here.
  - `Makefile: Run the test suite or build a local copy of this
    documentation.  Note` that there is no "build" as such; source is
    automatically recompiled at loading time as needed.
  - `doc/` : Some stuff for generating the pictures that appear in this
    README.
  - `LICENSE`: The AGPLv3, under which Adaptive Plot is licensed.

- Test suite

  - Run it with `make test`.
  - The `test/` directory contains the actual test suite (with some
    test-time-only utilities in test/utils.scm).
  - The `testing/` directory is a git submodule pointed at the [Test
    Manager](http://github.com/axch/test-manager/) framework that the
    test suite relies upon.


Portability
===========

Adaptive Plot is written in and for MIT Scheme on Ubuntu, and no
particular effort has been invested in porting it to other platforms.
That said, I expect porting should be a matter of tedium, not
invention.  The portability problems I anticipate are

- Live Scheme windows: Every mature Scheme system on every OS has a
  graphics API, but they are all different.  A sufficient portability
  layer should not be impossible (after all, all I do with windows is
  draw points and lines on them), but it may be simpler to drop this
  convenience feature.
- Calling out to Gnuplot: Every mature Scheme system has a mechanism
  to ask the operating system to invoke external programs, and again,
  they are all different.  This is in the same category as the live
  windows, but less painful.
- Code style idiosyncracies: I liberally rely upon various functions
  and syntax provided by MIT Scheme that are not standard for Scheme.
  Other Schemes have similar constructs with different syntax; this
  should be just a bunch of doc-grovelling.
- The unit test suite: is written in my [Test
  Manager](http://github.com/axch/test-manager/) framework, which you would also need to
  port if you wanted the test suite; but that should be easier.

Bugs
====

Adaptive Plot does not deal gracefully with functions that approach
infinity within the plotting range.  In particular, the adaptive
refinement will tend to try to explore the vicinity of the singularity.  This
makes two problems: effort will be spent on computing very large values
of the function, which are likely to be both inaccurate and
uninteresting; and the plotter might hit a value where the function is
actually undefined, possibly causing a crash.

Clipping the y range does not prevent Adaptive Plot from trying to
explore that geometry.  To wit, if the function has something
interesting, like a high curvarture area, or a discontinuity (or a
singularity!) in the given x range but outside the given y range,
Adaptive Plot will try to explore it anyway, wasting computational
effort.

If the function being plotted is not actually a function (for example,
has some internal state, or is randomized), Adaptive Plot will neither
detect this nor react.  You'll just get a very jumbled and confused plot,
which may require very many points to make (and refinement may even
not terminate).

`gnuplot`, `regnuplot`, and `plot-gnu!` are synchronous, so you can't
have both your REPL and the gnuplot window open at the same time.

Parabolic refinement doesn't actually pick the point of greatest
anticipated convergence of areas.  There is a subtle bug in the
parabola geometry code (see `parabolas.scm`) such that I don't
actually know how to characterize the next point it picks.  However,
it does pick something reasonable, and the results are still
aesthetic, so this is a performance (and reproducibility) problem
rather than a correctess problem.

Unimplemented Features
======================

Generalize adaptive refinement to parametric curves.  The concept is
identical, except that the higher-order extrapolation is now trying
guess the value of the parameter that would produce the greatest
improvement in a piecewise linear approximation to a curve.

Maybe generalize to plotting more than one function at once.
Multifunction plots can already be accomplished with
`plot-relevant-points`, `gnuplot-write-alist`, and some glue, but
there may be some additional adaptiveness to be derived from plotting
multiple functions at once.  For example, the piecewise linear
approximations that adaptive refinement produces can be good starting
points to look for intersections (or to confirm their absence); if
such features are of interest, the plotting could focus more effort in
such locations.

Maybe generalize to Poincare sections, which often still draw
continuous curves, but jump around sporadically inside them.  Poincare
sections of chaotic trajectories are even more fun, because they jump
around inside an area, that is nonetheless bounded by continuous
curves.
